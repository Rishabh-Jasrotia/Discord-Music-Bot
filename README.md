# Discord-Music-Bot
Its Just a personal project to learn the workings of discord.py library.
This bot connects to a Voice Channel in a Discord Guild/Server and plays music or audio (using the Google Youtube API) based on the commands given to it through text chat.
It was initially hosted on Heroku and later on Google Cloud but is now down because of the exertion of free quota.
